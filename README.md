# load-forecasting-for-smart-grid
Assessment and Comparison of Classical and Machine Learning based Load Forecasting for Smart Grid
Tech used: Machine Learning,Python,NumPy,Pandas,Scikit learn,Matplotlib,TensorFlow,Statsmodels,Linear Regression,
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE),Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU),Exponential Smoothing
•Implemented Multiple Linear Regression, Exponential Smoothing, Artificial Neural Network, and Gated Recurrent
Unit models for load forecasting across 5 state load dispatch centers.
•Identified the GRU model as the top performer with an exceptionally low MSE of 0.00002043654
•Achieved significant performance improvement by implementing ANN and GRU, leading to a reduction in MSE ranging
from 99.12% to 99.55% compared to classical Exponential Smoothing and MLR methods.

Only 1 company is uploaded here, I did it for 5 load dispatch centers of Delhi.
